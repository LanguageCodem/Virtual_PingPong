Welcome to the Ping Pong game! This simple yet engaging game is developed in C++. Although it's currently a work in progress and lacks features like AI and multiplayer mode, it's functional and ready for you to enjoy a basic version of the classic game.

How to Play

Prerequisites

- Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
  
Getting Started

- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the directory containing the game files.
- Compile the game using your preferred C++ compiler.
- Run the compiled executable.

Controls

- Use the arrow keys (up and down) to control the paddle.
- Press 'Q' to quit the game at any time.

Gameplay

- The objective of the game is to score points by hitting the ball past your opponent's paddle.
- The ball will bounce off the walls and the paddles.
- If you miss hitting the ball with your paddle, your opponent scores a point.
- The game continues until one player reaches the winning score (which is currently not implemented).

Features (Work in Progress)

AI Player
- Implementing an AI opponent to play against the player.
- The AI will move its paddle automatically to defend against the ball and try to score points.

Multiplayer Mode
- Adding support for two-player mode where players can compete against each other.
- Each player will control their own paddle using separate input controls.
